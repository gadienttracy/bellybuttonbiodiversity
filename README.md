# bellybuttonbiodiversity
## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to analyze the bacteria present within the bellybuttons of volunteers.  Visualizations were created for each participant to determine the most frequently occuring bacteria (bar chart), how often they wash their belly button (gauge chart), and the number of cultures per sample (bubble chart).
